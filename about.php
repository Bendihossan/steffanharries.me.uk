                <p>I grew up in Llanelli, a coastal town with a history in the "<em>old industries</em>" and a passion for rugby. I've recently moved and now live in Cardiff with my fiancé where I work in a software engineering role for a leading UK software development agency. I can speak a little Welsh and love our culture and history.

                <p>Aberystwyth was my home for four years whilst I studied and worked at the <a href="http://www.aber.ac.uk/" target="_blank">University</a>. Aber is a sleepy town on the coast of Mid Wales set away from busy life. I studied Internet Computing in AU's <a href="http://www.aber.ac.uk/en/cs/" target="_blank">Computer Science</a> Department. People say that you get caught in the "<em>Aber Trap</em>" - once you enter you may never leave. That's partly because Aber is so beautiful and friendly and partly because the transport links are so bad it simply may not be possible!

                <p>After leaving Aberystwyth I started working in Cardiff. I'd been trying for jobs long before my final exams even started and by April I'd had two offers of employment! Lucky, I definitely was. I started working a couple of weeks before graduation as a web developer in June 2012. Cardiff is a great place to live and has an awesome scene for web design and development. I can definitely see myself living and working in Cardiff for some time.</p>
