                <h2>Web &amp; Internet</h2>
                <p>Web development is my trade and it's what I love. The web is a massively growing portal of information and developing methods of providing all that content without overloading people and still keeping them interested is a unique challenge. Similarly, providing access to content on mobile devices while keeping loading times low on slower mobile connections is often very difficult. These challenges are being tackled by responsive web design and mobile web content strategy which are trends that are ever evolving.</p>

                <h2>Experience</h2>
                <h3>Aberystwyth University's Web Team</h3>
                <p>I've built sites for individuals and small organisations and business across Wales. The first large scale website I worked on was Aberystwyth University's corporate site and academic sub-sites which received hundreds of thousands of visitors on a very regular basis. I was responsible for front-end development and web application development in a team with five others as well as providing support to CMS (Content Management System) users on an ad-hoc basis. We were the first port of call for anyone within the University looking to manage content on the website. </p>
                <h3>Box UK</h3>
                <p>I'm currently working for Box UK in Cardiff city centre. In my short time with them I've worked on a large Welsh Government funded project, a major utilities company website and an internal application for a major electronics components manufacturer. The wealth of information I'm learning through working with these highly capable developers is astronomical. The people at Box UK are highly intelligent and extremely welcoming and friendly. The company blog often features unboxing articles on brand new technologies and tools as well as releases for open source software.</p>
