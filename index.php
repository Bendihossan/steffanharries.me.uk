                I'm a twenty-something web developer from Llanelli now living in Cardiff. I received a BSc (Hons) in Internet Computing from <a href="http://www.aber.ac.uk/en/cs/" target="_blank" >Aberystwyth University's Computer Science</a> Department and I'm a Professional Member (MBCS) of the <a href="http://www.bcs.org/" target="_blank">British Computing Society</a>.
                <p>I like taking photos and put the ones I like the most on <a href="http://www.flickr.com/steffanharries" target="_blank">Flickr</a>. I've won a few competitions and made a lot of friends through photography at camera clubs, university and online. I like shooting <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/steffanharries/5625335984/in/photostream/lightbox/" target="_blank">landscapes on the beach</a> &amp; <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/steffanharries/6685749357/in/photostream/lightbox/" target="_blank">military aircraft</a> the most. </p>

            <p>Front-end and PHP web development are my favoured areas and implementing responsive web design principles is something I've been following closely for the last few years. My availability for freelance work is limited but possible. Contact me for more information on availability. If I can't help you, I can often find someone who can.

            <h2><a class="home-link" href="/photography">Photography</a> <i class="icon-camera"></i></h2>
            <p>I love photography and post photos to <a href="http://www.flickr.com/steffanharries" target="_blank">Flickr</a>. I've shot weddings in the past as a second shooter and by myself on half a dozen occasions with positive results.</p>

            <p>I now shoot entirely for fun and have never enjoyed it more. Use of my work is strictly prohibited but I do provide high resolution copies for those who ask nicely.</p>
