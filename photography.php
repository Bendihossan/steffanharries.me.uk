            <p>I frequently upload photos to <a href="http://www.flickr.com/steffanharries/" target="_blank">Flickr</a>, a popular photo sharing service. My passion lies in shooting landscape and military aviation photography. Britain has a fantastic opportunity for landscape photography and is something I love capturing in photos. Wales also hosts a low level military training area for the RAF where a short 20 minute walk up the right hill can give you an opportunity to witness their most skilled pilots navigate the narrow Welsh valleys.

            <p>I was lucky enough to shoot a number of weddings between 2008 and 2012 whilst I was at university. I started shooting alongside other more established photographers and also shot some alone with success. Doing so greatly helped me afford the high costs of higher education. I now shoot purely for enjoyment and don't offer any services. However, I know many people in the photography industry so if you <a href="/contact">contact me</a> I can pass information on to many other photographers all over the UK.
